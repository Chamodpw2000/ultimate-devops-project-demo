This section defines how the Kubernetes Service exposes network traffic:

port: 8080
The port on which the Service is exposed inside the cluster. 
Other pods and services will use this port to communicate with the Service.

name: tcp-service
A name for the port, useful for reference and clarity, especially if there are multiple ports.

targetPort: 8080
The port on the selected pods where traffic will be forwarded. This means requests to the Service on port 8080 
are sent to port 8080 on the matching pods.

In summary:
Traffic sent to the Service on port 8080 is forwarded to port 8080 on the backend pods. 
The name helps identify the port, especially in multi-port services.
